# Ouragan

*A LambdaZKWeek project - 3rd place ðŸ¥‚*

Ouragan is a permissionless and censorship resistant Tornado Cash offramp. 

It consists of a suite of circuits and contracts which make it possible for two unrelated parties to trustessly and privately seed wallets with ETH. 

This is an interesting setup for a number of reasons:
- Alice might not want to reveal her identity to the Tornado Cash relayer when seeding her wallet
- Alice might not want her wallet to interact with Tornado Cash when withdrawing funds
- Bob gets a premium for providing Alice the ability to seed her wallet

### Main Components

- `core`: Contains the circuits and contracts that make up the core of the protocol.
- `front`: Contains a simple frontend implementation of the protocol. (WIP)

Install the packages and run all tests:

```
$ cd core
$ npm install 
$ npm test
```

### Architecture Limitations

- Bob knows Aliceâ€™s seeded address. In particular Bob can correlate the address that Alice used to deposit funds in Tornado Cash at step 3 with the address that got seeded at step 5.
- The protocol doesn't work if Alice has already deposited into Tornado Cash. Alice needs to agree on the deal with Bob before depositing to Tornado Cash. Ideally the protocol should work retroactively.
- We would like to be able to do 1 TC deposit to seed N addresses. Might be possible to update TC protocol and leverage recursivity. One TC deposit note could be used for seeding N wallets.
